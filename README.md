This repository contains machine learning use cases with real-world examples. Several machine learning algorithms have been used in solving the use cases. I am trying to brush up on my machine learning and deep learning knowledge. My target is to do hands-on exercises by using several ML algorithms to attain in-depth intuition. Also, I will clarify my knowledge of classification metrics, hypothesis testing, and so on. Furthermore, I will brush up on the mathematical formulas behind each of the algorithms.
